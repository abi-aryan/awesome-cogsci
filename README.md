As the name goes, our aim is to create a reference guide for all the information that could serve as a great guiding point to someone who is getting started in research that lies at the intersection of these three beautifully meshed fields of Psychology, Neuroscience and Computer Science . 

Please feel free to contribute by opening a new issue or responding to existing ones. To start adding to this guide, please open a pull request.
