# [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge-flat2.svg)](https://awesome.re) Cognitive Science

As the name goes, our aim is to create a reference guide for all the information that could serve as a great guiding point to someone who is getting started in research that lies at the intersection of the beautifully meshed fields studied under a catch-all called Cognitive Science.
